		<h3>Javascript Execution</h3>
		<pre>
			1. Our Javascript Code  
				---> parse code by using data structure called Abstract Syntax Tree(browser engine - every browser has its own engine) 
					---> converting to machine code 
						---> code runs


			2. Execution Context - A box or container or a wrapper which stores variables and in which a piece of code is evaluated and executed

			3. Global Execution Context associated with window object, not inside any function.
			lastname === window.lastname (true)

			4.
			  => Execution context
			     -- Variable Object
			     	- The argument object created, containing all the aguments that were passed into the function.
			     	- Code is scanned for function declorations: for each function,  a property is created in variable object, pointing to the function.
			     	- Code is scanned for variable declorations: for each variable, a property is created in variable object and set to undefined.
			     -- Scope Chain
			     	- where can we access certain variable
			     	- Each new function creates a scope
			     	- Lexical scoping: a function that is lexically within another function gets access to the scope of the outer function.
			     -- This variable
			     	- Regular function call : The this keyword points at the global object(the window object in the browser)
			     	- Method call : the this variable points to the object that is calling the method.
